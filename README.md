1. Jira Setup:

To set up a Jira Cloud instance and navigate to the project board, follow these steps:

1. Create a Jira Cloud Account:

Go to Jira Cloud and sign up or log in with your existing Atlassian account.



2. Create a New Jira Cloud Instance:

Once logged in, you'll be directed to your Jira dashboard. If you donâ€™t have a Jira instance, you can create a new one by selecting "Create Project" from the dashboard or choosing the "Get Started" button.



3. Choose a Project Template:

Jira offers various project templates (Scrum, Kanban, etc.). Choose the one that suits your project. For example, if you're using an Agile method, select the Scrum or Kanban template.



4. Set Up Your Project:

Enter the project name, key (for short reference), and configure other settings like the project lead and permissions.



5. Navigate to the Project Board:

Once the project is created, go to the sidebar on the left, and under "Projects," select the project you just created. This will open the project board where you can manage your tasks and view various project activities.

2. Basic Git Operations:

To push the updated project file to GitHub, follow these Git commands:

1. Stage Changes:

git add <file-name>  # Stages the updated file for commit

Or to stage all modified files:

git add .


2. Commit Changes:

git commit -m "Your commit message describing the changes"


3. Push Changes to GitHub:

git push origin <branch-name>  # Pushes changes to the specified branch on GitHub



For example, if you're working on the main branch:

git push origin main

3. JQL Search:

To find all Jira issues assigned to you with the status "In Progress," use the following JQL (Jira Query Language) query:

assignee = currentUser() AND status = "In Progress"

This will return all issues where the assignee is the current logged-in user and the status is "In Progress."
