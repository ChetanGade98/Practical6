To view the active sprint board, click on Active Sprint in the left-hand sidebar, where you'll see the tasks currently in progress for the sprint.



3. Configure a Kanban board and customize columns:

Go to your Jira project.

Click on Board settings (in the top-right corner).

Navigate to Dashboards in the top navigation bar and select Create dashboard.

Choose a layout, and give the dashboard a name.

Add gadgets like:

Filter Results (for open issues).

Sprint Health (to display the current sprint).

Pie Chart or Created vs. Resolved Chart (to display completed tasks).


Configure the gadgets to show data based on your project and desired filters.



6. Create a dashboard for sprint progress and issue breakdown by status:

Follow the same steps as above to create a new dashboard.

Add the following gadgets:

Sprint Health or Burndown Chart (to track sprint progress).

priority = High AND project = "Your Project Name" AND status != Done

Save the filter by clicking on Save as and give it a name (e.g., "High Priority Issues").
